The Snowplow Tracking CLI is a command-line app (written in Golang) to make it easy to send an event to Snowplow from the command line. Use this to embed Snowplow tracking into your shell scripts.

### Install

Add snowplowtrk and its package dependencies to your go src directory.

```
go get -v github.com/snowplow/snowplow-tracking-cli
```

Once the get completes, you should find your new `snowplowtrk` executable sitting inside `$GOPATH/bin/`.

To update snowplowtrk dependencies, use `go get` with the `-u` option.

```
go get -u -v github.com/snowplow/snowplow-tracking-cli
```

### Usage

The app is called `snowplowtrk`.

The command line interface is as follows:

```bash
snowplowtrk --appid={{APP_ID}} --method=[POST|GET] --sdjson={{SELF_DESC_JSON}} {{COLLECTOR_DOMAIN}}
```
    
or:

```bash
snowplowtrk --appid={{APP_ID}} --method=[POST|GET] --schema={{SCHEMA_URI}} --json={{JSON}} {{COLLECTOR_DOMAIN}}
```

where:

* `{{COLLECTOR_DOMAIN}}` is the domain for your Snowplow collector, e.g. `snowplow-collector.acme.com`
* `--appid` is optional (not sent if not set)
* `--method` is optional. Defaults to `GET`
* `--sdjson` is a self-describing JSON of the standard form `{ "schema": "iglu:xxx", "data": { ... } }`
* `--schema` is a schema URI, most likely of the form `iglu:xxx`
* `--json` is a (non-self-describing) JSON, of the form `{ ... }`

The idea here is that you can either send in a self-describing JSON, or pass in the constituent parts (i.e. a regular JSON plus a schema URI) and the Snowplow Tracking CLI will construct the final self-describing JSON for you.

# Examples
```bash
snowplowtrk --appid myappid --method POST --schema iglu:com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow/event/jsonschema/1-0-0 --json "{\"hello\":\"world\"}" snowplow-collector.acme.com
```

```bash
snowplowtrk --appid myappid --method POST --sdjson "{\"schema\":\"iglu:com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow/event/jsonschema/1-0-0\", \"data\":{\"hello\":\"world\"}}" snowplow-collector.acme.com
```

Return codes:

* 0 if the Snowplow collector responded with an OK status (2xx or 3xx)
* 4 if the Snowplow collector responded with a 4xxx status
* 5 if the Snowplow collector responded with a 5xx status
* 1 for any other error

Under the hood:

* There is no buffering - each event is sent as an individual payload whether `GET` or `POST`
* The Snowplow Tracking CLI will exit once the Snowplow collector has responded
* The app uses the [Snowplow Golang Tracker](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-golang-tracker)
